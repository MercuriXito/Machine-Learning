Stored code for classification
  Code:
    Logistic2.py / Logistic2.pyc (Logistic Regression with linear model)
  
  DataSource:
    1. ex2data1.txt (Linear)
    2. ex2data2.txt (Polynomial)
    Data above comes from lesson, Machine Learning, on Coursera
    
  Description:
    After I learned the course, I tried to implement the basic algorithm with python so I can better understand the algorithm.
    And for further understanding, I chose to use some basic library, numpy and matplotlib, instead of using some famous library in Machine Learning field such as scikit-learn and so on.
