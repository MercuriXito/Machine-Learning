Code saved for linear regression
  Code:
    1. LinearRegression.py:
      basic solution for linear regression without quadratic polynomial term, theta can be solved both by BSG or Normal Equation
      
  Dataset:
    1.ex1data1.txt (Univariate linear regression)
      ex1data2.txt (Multivariate linear regression)
      Also from courses, Machine Learning, on coursera
      
  Description:
    Get myself much more familiar about numpy and matplotlib
    And afterwards I would try to implement regularization
